# Project Description 
CloudDrop is an innovative IoT solution designed to monitor, detect, and log the occurrence of specific sound events, such as those produced by a hand sanitizer dispenser. The system leverages sound detection technology to identify events, timestamps and logs them, then periodically logs them to a cloud platform. By providing real-time analytics and insights, CloudDrop aims to enhance hygiene compliance monitoring in public and private spaces. The solution is lightweight, cost-effective, and scalable, with intended usage in a wide range of industries such as healthcare, hospitality, retail, and education.
